We are a group of passionate educators who love creating & inventing fun, hands-on ways to introduce students from 6 – 14 to scientific concepts.

We are committed to recycling and reuse, and we love creating experiments which use everyday materials.

We find that children pick up and understand scientific principles by osmosis and the child’s confidence grows, while interactively completing experiments & working with the others in the group.​ 

We love teaching children science & we run birthday parties, after school clubs and school holiday camps.

Holiday Camps
Camps run during school holidays, which provides time to explore a wide variety of topics in depth. Day 1, may start the week with the investigation of hydroponics which includes examining the structure of a seed and then planting it in water. This topic may not be returned to until Friday, when we will discover how much the seeds have grown. 

A favourite activity is designing and building games, which children will do from scratch while learning a scientific principal!

All camps have an outdoor area & campers get to go outside to play, interact with nature, breath & relax.

Respect, friendship & support are 3 of our key beliefs. 

Camps run for 4 hours per day.
